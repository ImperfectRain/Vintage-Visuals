// Vintage Visuals - pseudo-PBR material response
//
// Injected into chunkopaque.fsh by shaderpatches/pseudopbr.yaml, anchored on
// vanilla's `uniform sampler2D liquidDepth`  -  the LAST sampler vanilla
// declares. That position is the single most load-bearing decision in this
// file, and it was learned the hard way.
//
// WHY IT MUST GO AFTER EVERY VANILLA SAMPLER
//
// Declaring `vv_materialTex` earlier in the file shifted vanilla's remaining
// samplers by one when the program linked: glow took sky's unit, sky took
// liquidDepth's, and liquidDepth took a unit nothing was ever bound to. A
// liquidDepth that reads nothing makes getUnderwaterMurkiness() saturate to 1,
// and applyUnderwaterEffects then mixes EVERYTHING this shader draws to
// waterMurkColor. In game that looked like the world had gone transparent  - 
// only grass tops survived, because they come from chunktopsoil.fsh, which
// this mod does not patch. Same cause both times it broke; only the water
// colour differed.
//
// So: declared last, after terrainTex, terrainTexLinear, shadowMapFar,
// shadowMapNear, glow, sky and liquidDepth. Vanilla keeps units 0..6 and this
// takes what is left. Anchoring on the last of them is what enforces it  -  if a
// game update adds an eighth sampler below liquidDepth, the anchor still puts
// us above it, so re-check this when the sampler list changes.
//
// The atlas matches the block texture atlas's layout exactly, so it samples
// with the very same `uv` the diffuse uses. Channels:
//   R,G = tangent-space normal X,Y   B = roughness   A = specular

// The anchor line, pasted back. The patch REPLACES it with this whole file, so
// dropping this would delete the sampler the underwater code depends on  -  the
// exact failure this layout exists to prevent.
